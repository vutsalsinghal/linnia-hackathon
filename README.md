### Description: 
We've built an application using Linnia Protocol to spread, promote and advertise any _**secret**_ event (meetup, exclusive workshop, private dining, etc) to the inner-circle of members. Existing members can refer their friends to join the inner-circle.

#### User Stories
- You are an organizer: Create an event using `Add Event` form to secretly share the details with the inner-circle.
- You are a member: View and accept invite to upcoming event and send referrals to expand the circle.
* You are refered by a member: Accept the referral extended by a member using your ETH address and public key and then accept invitation to upcoming event.
